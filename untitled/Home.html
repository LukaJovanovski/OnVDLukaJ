            <h4>The French Defense</h4><h3>Defense for Black against 1.e4<br>
            Opening moves: 1.e4 e6</h3><img src="../sliki/frenc.png" style="float:left; width:45%;">
            The French Defense is a great opening for beginners for many reasons. First of all, it’s a very solid and challenging opening against 1.e4 (the most common first move). If you play the French Defense and like it, you can easily stick with it your entire chess career. In fact, it’s the preferred response to 1.e4 for many legendary players past and present – Mikhail Botvinnik, Viktor Korchnoi, Tatev Abrahamyan, and Georg Meier just to name a few!

            Second, the French Defense teaches many fundamental chess principles very well. You’ll learn much about pawn breaks and pawn structure, fighting for the center, attacking on the wings, and improving pieces. It will also give you insight into dealing with it as White if you play 1.e4, as the French is one of the most common defenses against 1.e4.

            White has several ways to play against the defense, but for now you should focus on the most common: the Advance Variation (3.e5) and the Exchange Variation (3.exd5).

            Chessable has many great courses on the French – try it out for free with Short & Sweet: French Defense by USCF National Master Bryan Tillis.

        <div id="op2"><h4>The Sicilian Defense</h4><h3> Defense for Black against 1.e4

            Opening moves: 1.e4 c5</h3><img src="../sliki/sici.png" style="float:right;">If you watch any major chess tournament, you’ll get the impression that the Sicilian Defense is the favorite defense of seemingly every grandmaster out there. And for good reason! The Sicilian is one of the most combative ways to play against 1.e4.

            If you’re not afraid of more aggressive and tactical play, it’s a great substitute for the French Defense as Black. But for the same reasons, you’ll definitely want to know how to handle this opening from White’s perspective, as it is one of the most common and challenging.

            The tricky part about the Sicilian for beginners is that there are a plethora of variations – the Najdorf, Dragon, Sveshnikov, Kan, Taimanov, Scheveningen, Classical, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg. There are also anti-Sicilian systems, such as the Closed Sicilian, Alapin Sicilian, and Smith-Morra Gambit.

            With all these variations out there, it sounds like a real chore. But if you learn the solid  Najdorf Variation (3…a6) as both Black and White, you should be playing the Sicilian with success in no time.</div>

        <section id="history" class="bordy"><h1 class="cllr bordy black">Origin</h1><p>Chess is believed to have originated in India during the Gupta Empire around the 6th century AD. The game was known as Chaturanga, which means "four divisions of the military"—infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots, represented by pieces that evolved into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook.</p>
           <h5> Spread to Persia:</h5>

            The game spread to Persia, where it became known as Shatranj. The Persian names for the pieces were adopted, and the rules began to resemble modern chess more closely. The game was popular among the nobility and became a part of Persian culture.
            <h5>Expansion into the Islamic World:</h5>

            After the Islamic conquest of Persia, Shatranj spread throughout the Islamic world. It was during this period that the game further evolved. Chess was introduced to Europe by the Moors in Spain and the Byzantine Empire.</section>
